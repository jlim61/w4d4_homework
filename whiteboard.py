# How to solve a problem:
    # Figure out what the input and its type are
    # Set up a function
    # Figure out what the output and its type are
    # Gather Your Knowledge
    # Gathers Your Constraints (Not always necessary) 
    # Determine a Logical way to solve the problem
        #Write each step out English
        #Write each step out in Python-esse (sudo-code)
    # Invoke and Test Your Function


# FizzBuzz Coding Challenge ðŸŒŸ

# Objective:
# Your task is to implement a Python function called fizzbuzz that takes a positive integer as an argument and returns a string based on specific conditions. This is a well-known coding problem that assesses basic control flow and logical reasoning skills.

# Requirements:
# Function Name: fizzbuzz
# Input: A single positive integer.
# Output: A string that adheres to the following conditions:
# If the input integer is divisible by both 3 and 5, return "FizzBuzz".
# If the input integer is divisible by 3 but not 5, return "Fizz".
# If the input integer is divisible by 5 but not 3, return "Buzz".
# If the input integer is neither divisible by 3 nor 5, return the integer as a string.


'''
function = fizzbuzz
input: positive integer -> maybe put in a condition to account for negative numbers
output: returns a string based on conditions
if int is divisible by 3 AND 5, return FizzBuzz -> seems maybe written out what it needs to do for constraint already?
if int is divisible by 3 but not 5, return Fizz
if int is divisible by 5 but not 3 return Buzz
if neither is divisible, then return the integer as a string
